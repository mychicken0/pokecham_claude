# 09 — Stat / Damage / Type / Board Math Guide v29.43

This file owns numeric and mechanical math. Source policy lives in `02`; command syntax lives in `04`.

## 1. Stat formula

Pokémon Champions level 50 formula used by the verifier:

```text
HP = Base HP + 75 + HP investment
Non-HP = floor((Base + 20 + investment) * nature_modifier)
```

Displayed stats must come from `verify.py stat` or team render receipts. No stat receipt = no stat number or public stat adjective such as ถึก/บาง/เร็ว/ช้า, bulky/frail/fast/slow. Do not use mainline stat formulas, EV/IV language, or hand-computed stats in final prose.

## 2. Investment rules

Champions investment is not 252 EVs.

- Each stat investment: 0-32.
- Total investment: exactly 66/66.
- Public spread format must label stats: `HP 2 / Atk 32 / Def 0 / SpA 0 / SpD 0 / Spe 32`.
- Bare slash spreads are not public-safe unless the order is explicitly labeled.

## 3. Active form stat source

Active form must be resolved before stat, type, ability, damage, and public display.

Examples:

- Mega form uses Mega base stats and active battle ability.
- Aegislash stance uses active stance row.
- Palafin Hero-style claims fail closed unless the local active form row and trigger are present.

No active-form receipt = no active-form stat/type/ability claim.

## 4. Typechart multiplication

Use `verify.py typechart` for every type-effectiveness claim.

- Multiply across all defender types.
- Do not stop after the first type.
- 0x immunity overrides by multiplication.
- Public words such as immune/resist/super effective/neutral/weak/0x/0.5x/2x require a typechart receipt.

Locked examples:

```text
Ghost → Dark = 0.5x resisted
Ghost → Normal = 0x immune
Fire → Steel/Dragon = 1x neutral
Fighting → Steel/Dragon = 2x super_effective
Ground → Flying = 0x immune
Ground → Sinistcha = 0.5x resisted
```

## 4.1 Type matrix receipts

Use `verify.py type-matrix <team.json> [targets.json]` for team-level type analysis. Defensive matrix must cover every attacking type into every team slot. Offensive matrix must use only actual move types on the submitted sets.

No public team matchup, coverage, weakness, resistance, or immunity claim should be written from memory when a type-matrix or direct typechart receipt can be generated.

## 5. Type passive properties

Typechart is not typepassive. Use `verify.py typepassive` for type-wide passive/status/weather/hazard properties.

Covered local passive families include:

- Grass vs Leech Seed / powder / spore.
- Fire burn immunity.
- Electric paralysis immunity.
- Ground vs Thunder Wave.
- Flying ungrounded hazard immunity.
- Rock/Ground/Steel sandstorm chip immunity.
- Rock SpD boost in sandstorm.
- Ice Defense boost in snow and hail chip immunity.
- Poison/Steel poison immunity with Corrosion exception.
- Grounded Poison clearing Toxic Spikes.
- Ghost trapping/cannot-escape immunity.
- Dark vs opposing Prankster-boosted Status moves.

No typepassive receipt = no passive/status/weather/hazard claim.

## 6. Weather and field stat modifiers

Weather/field stat changes must come from receipts, not memory.

Examples requiring receipts:

- Sandstorm Rock SpD modifier.
- Snow Ice Defense modifier.
- Weather speed abilities such as Sand Rush / Swift Swim / Chlorophyll / Slush Rush.
- Terrain or field rules such as Electric Terrain / Aurora Veil.

## 7. Damage receipt rules

Use `verify.py damage` for concrete damage claims. v29.42 damage receipts must expose `modifier_breakdown`, `damage_completeness`, `public_ko_claim_allowed`, and any `missing_relevant_modifiers`. If STAB/type/weather/item/ability/move-dynamic sources are hidden or missing, the damage receipt is partial/incomplete.

Public claims requiring damage/sequence receipts:

- OHKO / 2HKO.
- survival / guaranteed survival.
- damage ranges or percentages.
- Life Orb / weather / terrain / item damage modifiers.
- Stamina or staged-hit sequence claims.


### 7.1 Damage modifier strictness

`verify.py damage` may use local core STAB and typechart, but every modifier must be visible. v29.42 applies exact item/ability/weather/move-dynamic modifiers only from `data/10_structured_mechanic_receipts.jsonl`.

```text
stab: source LOCAL_DAMAGE_ENGINE_CORE_STAB or structured STAB override
type: source verify.py typechart
weather/item/ability/move-dynamic: source structured_mechanic_receipt, or listed as missing/partial
```

Do not infer these from memory inside damage prose: Life Orb, Choice Band/Specs, Adaptability, Supreme Overlord, Sun/Rain damage, Weather Ball type/power, Solar Beam charge skip, or Helping Hand. If the entity is absent from current `08_global_moves_abilities_items.csv`, do not add/use the mechanic at all. Choice Band and Choice Specs are absent in this pack and remain blocked.


### 7.2 Complete-modifier gate

Use complete mode before public OHKO/2HKO/survival claims:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify.py damage <scenario.json> --require-complete-modifiers
```

If complete mode fails, public output may mention only that the local receipt is partial/lower-bound. Do not state guaranteed KO/survival.

Use mechanic data checks after editing the pack:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify.py mechanic-data-lint
python3 scripts/verify.py mechanic-coverage
python3 scripts/verify.py mechanic-effect "Life Orb" --context damage
```

Every move/item/ability structured receipt must reference an entity confirmed in current 08. Classification coverage is required for all current 08 moves/items/abilities, but classification is not the same as numeric implementation.

Damage calc input provenance matters. A valid damage number from a `LOCAL_FALLBACK` spread is not a meta benchmark. Label it as local/experimental unless the spread source is `META_SPREAD_DIRECT`, `TOURNAMENT_LIST_DIRECT`, or `USER_PROVIDED`.

## 8. Speed and priority resolution

Priority bracket is resolved before Speed. Speed only sorts within the same bracket.

Use receipts for:

- Fake Out priority.
- Prankster status priority.
- Trick Room priority and speed reversal.
- Tailwind/weather speed benchmarks.
- Gale Wings and other priority modifiers.
- Choice Scarf or item speed claims.

## 9. Board interaction math

For 2v2/Doubles, do not analyze as 1v1. Board claims require boardscan/interaction/counterroute receipts.

Check:

- all four slots
- ally damage
- Protect/Wide Guard
- redirection
- spread moves
- type immunity
- ability immunity/blocking
- field/terrain/weather conditions
- active form
- speed/priority order

Earthquake and other ally-hitting spread moves need ally-safety matrix before public “safe/good partner” claims.


## 10. Item-spread and survival benchmark policy

Do not use bulk/survival language without a receipt. Public claims that a spread “รอด”, “ทน”, “รับได้”, “survives”, “lives”, or “tanks” require a damage or sequence receipt.

Focus Sash reasoning is checked by item-spread coherence:

- default value: Speed, damage, or utility timing;
- bulky Sash spread: requires meta spread evidence or damage benchmark;
- weather/field move interactions used as spread reasons require mechanic, interaction, boardscan, or typepassive receipts.

## 11. Semantic threat and item math

Risk and item explanations must start from a semantic threat profile, not from a single remembered weakness.

Use:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify.py threataudit <team.json>
python3 scripts/verify.py itemthreatfit <team.json>
```

`threataudit` checks all type multipliers, base stat profile, and board risks such as ally Earthquake. `itemthreatfit` checks whether a defensive item/berry matches the full threat profile.

Examples:

- Steel/Dragon is Fighting 2x and Ground 2x, not Fighting 4x.
- “ถึกสองด้าน” needs HP/Def/SpD support; high Def with low SpD is physical bulk, not mixed bulk.
- Chople vs Shuca must compare Fighting weakness, Ground weakness, and actual board risk.
- If `verify.py mechanic Stamina` or `verify.py mechanic "Electro Shot"` fails, use only the `08` description wording and do not add exact `+1`/sequence details.

## 12. Benchmark policy

Meta baseline is the default for actionable builds. Team-fit override requires a benchmark.

Speed override needs speed benchmark.
Bulk override needs damage/survival benchmark.
Item/move override needs mechanic/team-fit/source reason.

If no benchmark supports the override, keep the meta baseline or label the alternative as `LOCAL_FALLBACK` / `EXPERIMENTAL`.


## 13. Speed-mode planning

Tailwind/Trick Room advice must use actual Speed receipts, not vague labels. Compare raw Speed, Tailwind effective Speed, Trick Room ordering, and priority bracket.

- Tailwind helps the active side when its intended attackers need to win the speed race.
- Trick Room helps the active side only when its intended attackers are slower than the relevant opponents.
- Trick Room can help the opponent if their active attackers are slower than yours.
- A team with Tailwind + Trick Room needs separate mode explanations and rejected/conditional lines.

No speedplan receipt = no public speed-mode recommendation.

## 14. Nature display and stat wording

`verify.py stat` is the source for displayed stats and nature effects. Public output must show both the nature name and its effect: `Adamant (+Atk / -SpA)`, `Jolly (+Spe / -SpA)`, `Calm (+SpD / -Atk)`, etc.

Do not calculate or describe natures from memory. Copy `nature_effect.display` from the stat/render receipt.

Use Champions wording:

- `spread` or `investment`: accepted public wording;
- `EVs`: warning / repair wording;
- `252 EV`, `IV`, level-50/mainline formulas: hard failure.
